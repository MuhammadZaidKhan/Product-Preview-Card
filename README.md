## Overview

This is a solution for the Product Preview Card Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. It is a responsive web component that displays a product preview card with an image, product details, and a button.

### The Challenge

The challenge was to create a product preview card that is visually appealing and responsive across different screen sizes. The card should display an image on the left side and product details on the right side. The design should be consistent with the provided design files.

### Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## What I Learned

During this project, I had the opportunity to improve my CSS skills and practice responsive design techniques. Some of the key things I learned include:

- Using flexbox to create responsive layouts
- Applying media queries to adapt the design for different screen sizes
- Working with fonts from Google Fonts
- Styling and positioning elements using CSS properties

I also gained experience in optimizing images for the web and using version control with Git and GitHub.

Overall, this project allowed me to enhance my front-end development skills and apply them to a real-world design challenge.
